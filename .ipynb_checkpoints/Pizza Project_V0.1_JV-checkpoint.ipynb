    "This competition contains a dataset with textual requests for pizza from the Reddit community - Random Acts of Pizza (https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/) together with their outcome (successful/unsuccessful) and meta-data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset includes 5671 requests collected from the Reddit community between December 8, 2010 and September 29, 2013 (retrieved on September 30, 2013). All requests ask for the same thing: a free pizza. The outcome of each request -- whether its author received a pizza or not -- is known. Meta-data includes information such as: time of the request, activity of the requester, community-age of the requester, etc.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Outcome of Project: By getting a sense of the dynamics and factors of a request that most likely would influence its success, the team hopes to build a model capable of predicting which requests will garner a cheesy (but sincere!) act of kindness and will result in a pizza purchase."

    "\n",
    "_General Note_ Many features not present in test data are not known at time of posting, therefore they will be ignored for this analysis. This includes the \"at retrieval\" statistics, RAOP \"user flair\", and raw (i.e. non-\"edit aware\") request text.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Time**  \n",
    "Time is a very basic but important feature to include. Logically, there are likely times of day when more users are active on RAOP and this may have varied effects on the behaviors we observe:  \n",
    "- More users requesting may make the environment more competitive (i.e. harder for a single post to stand out) \n",
    "- Conversely, more users giving may make likelihood of success higher (all things equal).  \n",
    "    - _NOTE_, however, that we cannot observe the time of giving in this dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "These periods of increased requests/gives may not coincide with one another and it will be important to understand the periods of high and low activity relative to UTC; there may be multiple shifts throughout a day coinciding with higher activity in different countries/time zones around the globe.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Requester Profile**    \n",
    "In attempting to predict likelihood of fulfillment for a request on RAOP based on featues related to the profile of the requester, we believe it may be important to make a distinction between: \n",
    "- _Primary_ profile features (i.e. features which an average reader/potential giver on RAOP may see/consider)\n",
    "    - Age of account - whether it appears to be a new/throwaway account or a longtime veteran  \n",
    "    - Number and frequency of requests - if the requester has made requests before\n",
    "- _Secondary_ features (i.e. extended detail about requester activity on Reddit that a potential giver might not see, and therefore it wouldn't have as much influence on their likelihood of fulfilling the request or not)  \n",
    "    - Comments made\n",
    "    - Posts\n",
    "    - Sub-Reddits in which they participate\n",
    "    - Upvotes/Downvotes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Community Effects (Secondary)**  \n",
    "The training data constains featues related to the reactions to a request on RAOP (upvotes/downvotes/comments) which, while not available in the test data and not appropriate for success classifcation algorithm (given that we don't know this info at time of the request nor do we know if this activity happened before/after the request was fulfilled), positive or contentious reactions to posts may be correlated with success/fulfillment. Therefore, it may be worhtwhile to explore these relationships and, if useful, a sensitivity analysis that predicts these metrics to provide additional insight into predictive features.  "
